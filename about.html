        <h2>History</h2>
        With increase in activity surrounding fitness, comfortable athleisure became a need â€“ a need Wholeness Fitness Athleisure could satisfy by working hard towards fulfilling our vision and achieving our mission. That became a driving force for creating comfortable, fashionable, sustainable, and functional fitness wear.
    </p>
    <p>
        What started out as nothing more than a vision in 2019 became reality early 2025 due to the high number of people in need of athleisure wear during that time. Showing that the business can cater to diverse people whether they are athletes, fitness enthusiasts, or are simply people with a value for comfortable stylishness in their daily lives. With increase in demand we set out to continue creating a brand that redefines athleisure and continues giving people high-performing and fashionable wear that can be everyday wear.
